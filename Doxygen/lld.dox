@version
Draft Crystals 00.00.00.01 (1-Sept-2015) 


@section sec_1		1. 	Introduction

	The Crystal system will hereafter be referred to as "the system".
	
	This document describes the system, its user interfaces, programming API and the interaction 
	and integration with other components.
	
	Installation of system is described within this document. 
    


@subsection sec_1_1	1.1	Overview

	The system has been implemented to search the content of various web sites for specific text
	and phrases.  This content is further processed, categorised and scored in terms of cohesion and tension.
	
	A stand-alone and Web based interface is available, for the configuration of the search tool.
	User login is required for both the full and demonstrator search.  This requirement is 
	necessary to prevent the tool from being used for malicious purposes.  E-mail confirmation 
	may be used during the registration process to restrict a users account to search a reduced set of domains. 

    Due to the nature of this tool, a scan is scheduled rather than executed immediately.  This allows the software
     to limit the amount of Internet traffic targeted at each site to prevent performance
    impact to a third parties site/service and reduce the likelihood of being mistaken as a denial of service style
     attack during the scan.  This could potentially result in the service being blacklisted and prevent future 
     mining of the site.
	
    Once scheduled the scan will be executed on a remote server rather than the users local machine.  
	This allows the user to continue working without impacting PC performance while a scan is executed.
    
    A notification will be posted when the scan is complete.

@subsection sec_1_2	1.2 Guide to the Document

	This document is designed to be formatted as a html document for viewing through
	a web browser. It is automatically generated using doxygen.
    
	
	It is intended for use by developers and customers to tune system options.
    

	This document is split into several sections, including manually generated sections
	and several automatically generated sections that detail the methods available.
    


@subsection sec_1_3	1.3	Assumptions

	Not applicable


@section sec_2		2.	Requirements Mapping

	The requirements for the system are mapped to the LLD in this LLD document.

	This document outlines the system's functional user requirements.
	
	It does not specify, functional or system requirements.
	The aim of this document is to specify, and later agree on, the functionality of the system from a user perspective. 
	    
	The requirements specified in this document can broadly be grouped in 4 MoSCoW categories:    

	Must     

	Should    

	Could    

	Will not    
    

	These indicate the priority of each requirement, "must" being the highest priority, and to more clearly define the system boundary.    

	The functional user requirements of the system are as follows:    

	1. The system must measure tension.	    

		1.1. Tension must be measurable using a nominal, dichotomous, and binary scale. For example, "tension" or "no tension".    

		1.2. Tension must be measurable on a non-dichotomous ordinal scale. For example, "no tension", "tension", "high tension".	    

		1.3. Tension must be measurable on a continuous ratio scale. For example, a decimal number between 0 and 1.
	2.    

		The system must measure cohesion.    

	3. Data sources:    

		3.1. The system must include Twitter as a data source.    

		3.2. The system should include the Police API as a data source.    

		3.3. The system should include authoritative news websites as a data source.    

		3.4. The system should include forums (discussion websites) as a data source.    

		3.5. The system will not include video, audio, or other non-textual data as a data source.    

		3.6. Users will not be able to modify the list of data sources.    

	4. Query constraints:    

		4.1. The system could allow the user to constrain queries such that data is limited (where applicable) to sources of a specific gender. For example, a query could be constrained to tweets from males only.    

			4.1.1. The gender of a source will be determined by the system and may not be 100% accurate.    

		4.2. Time:    

			4.2.1. The system will allow the user to constrain queries using a pre-defined time interval.    

			4.2.2. The system could allow the user to constrain queries using an arbitrary time interval.    

		4.3. The system will not allow ethnicity to be used as a query constraint.    

		4.4. The system will not allow age to be used as a query constraint.    

		4.5. The system will not allow socio-economic background to be used as a query constraint.    

		4.6. Geographic constraints:4.6.1.Geographic constraints for all sources:    

			4.6.1.1. The system must allow the user to constrain a query to use data that is related to a predefined geographic region.    

			4.6.1.2. The system should allow the user to constrain a query to use data that is related to a specific area that is bounded by a distance from a central point. 
			@code
			For example, within 1 mile of the point 51�33'16''N, 3�2'44''W.
			@endcode			

			4.6.1.3. The system could allow the user to constrain a query to use data that is related to a specific area that is bounded by a complex region. For example, within 10 miles of Cardiff.    

			4.6.2. Extra geographic constraints for Twitter:    

			4.6.2.1. The system must allow the user to constrain a query to use tweets that the system believes to be from a predefined geographic region.    

			4.6.2.2. The system should allow the user to constrain a query to use tweets that the system believes to be from a region that is bounded by a distance from a central point.    

			4.6.2.3. The system could allow the user to constrain a query to use tweets that the system believes to be from a complex region.
			
	5.Query reporting:    

		5.1. The user must be able to specify the frequency of proactive reporting. For example, a report should be generated once per week.    

		5.2. The user could be able to specify that a report will be generated when a specific trigger occurs. For example, the system could produce a report when a level of tension has been reached under specific query constraints.    

			5.2.1. The user could be able to specify the triggers that can be use

@subsection sec_3_2	3.2	Disabling Strategy
	
	There are no disabling requirements for the system.


@subsection sec_3_3	3.3	Logging Strategy
	
	Logging is achieved via Tomcat Catalina.out.  The system specific components 
	log to the same location for consistency.  By combining the log information within 
	this common file it simplifies diagnosis of interaction between components as the log
	provide a serialised view of the system and message exchange between components.


@section sec_4		4.	Security
	
	There are no security aspects specific to the system.  However there will exist a username.password 
	based connection within the WebLab GUI interface which may be used during initial configuration of
	the system.


@section sec_5		5.	Interactions and dependencies

	The system connects via the Internet to a number of external web sites to analyse each site.  For the system to function each site needs to be up and running.  If access is via a proxy server all necessary configuration parameters must be applied.
	
	@note The system automatically sends status reports and results to the parent website.

	
@subsection sec_5_1	5.1	Interactions with, and Dependencies on the Existing Systems
	
	The system has interaction and dependency on existing systems.
	WebLab Bundle 2.0.1 provides the framework for the system.
	The system is platform independent.  Refer to the systems requirements section for recommended system requirements.
	

@subsection sec_5_2 5.2 Interactions with, and Dependencies on new features
    
    As this is a new development there are no specific new features that have any interactions or
    dependencies with the system.  

    
@subsection sec_5_2 5.3 System Requirements
    
    Recommended system requirements:
      CentOS 6.5.
      8 core processor/s.
      16GB or Memory.
      2TB Hard disk.


@section sec_6		6.	Design Alternatives and Decisions

	The core of the system comprises of the Orchestration service and the Inferencing System.  These services may
	exist in a stand alone manor if desired.  The SiteCrawler can be used to provide crawled documents to the 
	systems as an alternative to the the full WebLab bundle if desired.  


@section sec_7		7.	Retrofit, Backward Compatibility and Interoperability

@subsection sec_7_1	7.1	Retrofit


Configuring Distributed WebLab

To ensure functionality remains intact during deployment, the supplied WebLab bundle is extracted on each server or VM intended to host one or more components.
