<h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_1"></a>
1. 	Introduction</h1>
<pre class="fragment">The Crystal system will hereafter be referred to as "the system".

This document describes the system, its user interfaces, programming API and the interaction 
and integration with other components.

Installation of system is described within this document. 
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_1_1"></a>
1.1	Overview</h2>
<pre class="fragment">The system has been implemented to search the content of various web sites for specific text
and phrases.  This content is further processed, categorised and scored in terms of cohesion and tension.

A stand-alone and Web based interface is available, for the configuration of the search tool.
User login is required for both the full and demonstrator search.  This requirement is 
necessary to prevent the tool from being used for malicious purposes.  E-mail confirmation 
may be used during the registration process to restrict a users account to search a reduced set of domains. 

Due to the nature of this tool, a scan is scheduled rather than executed immediately.  This allows the software
 to limit the amount of Internet traffic targeted at each site to prevent performance
impact to a third parties site/service and reduce the likelihood of being mistaken as a denial of service style
 attack during the scan.  This could potentially result in the service being blacklisted and prevent future 
 mining of the site.

Once scheduled the scan will be executed on a remote server rather than the users local machine.  
This allows the user to continue working without impacting PC performance while a scan is executed.

A notification will be posted when the scan is complete.

1.2 Guide to the Document</h2>
<pre class="fragment">This document is designed to be formatted as a html document for viewing through
a web browser. It is automatically generated using doxygen.


It is intended for use by developers and customers to tune system options.


This document is split into several sections, including manually generated sections
and several automatically generated sections that detail the methods available.

1.3	Assumptions</h2>
<pre class="fragment">Not applicable
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_2"></a>
2.	Requirements Mapping</h1>
<pre class="fragment">The requirements for the system are mapped to the LLD in this LLD document.

This document outlines the system's functional user requirements.

It does not specify functional or system requirements.
The aim of this document is to specify, and later agree on, the functionality of the system from a user perspective. 

The requirements specified in this document can broadly be grouped in 4 MoSCoW categories:    

Must     

Should    

Could    

Will not    


These indicate the priority of each requirement, "must" being the highest priority, and to more clearly define the system boundary.    

The functional user requirements of the system are as follows:    

1. The system must measure tension.     

    1.1. Tension must be measurable using a nominal, dichotomous, and binary scale. For example, "tension" or "no tension".    

    1.2. Tension must be measurable on a non-dichotomous ordinal scale. For example, "no tension", "tension", "high tension".       

    1.3. Tension must be measurable on a continuous ratio scale. For example, a decimal number between 0 and 1.
2.    

    The system must measure cohesion.    

3. Data sources:    

    3.1. The system must include Twitter as a data source.    

    3.2. The system should include the Police API as a data source.    

    3.3. The system should include authoritative news websites as a data source.    

    3.4. The system should include forums (discussion websites) as a data source.    

    3.5. The system will not include video, audio, or other non-textual data as a data source.    

    3.6. Users will not be able to modify the list of data sources.    

4. Query constraints:    

    4.1. The system could allow the user to constrain queries such that data is limited (where applicable) to sources of a specific gender. For example, a query could be constrained to tweets from males only.    

        4.1.1. The gender of a source will be determined by the system and may not be 100% accurate.    

    4.2. Time:    

        4.2.1. The system will allow the user to constrain queries using a pre-defined time interval.    

        4.2.2. The system could allow the user to constrain queries using an arbitrary time interval.    

    4.3. The system will not allow ethnicity to be used as a query constraint.    

    4.4. The system will not allow age to be used as a query constraint.    

    4.5. The system will not allow socio-economic background to be used as a query constraint.    

    4.6. Geographic constraints:4.6.1.Geographic constraints for all sources:    

        4.6.1.1. The system must allow the user to constrain a query to use data that is related to a predefined geographic region.    

        4.6.1.2. The system should allow the user to constrain a query to use data that is related to a specific area that is bounded by a distance from a central point.

</div><!-- fragment --><p>4.6.1.3. The system could allow the user to constrain a query to use data that is related to a specific area that is bounded by a complex region. For example, within 10 miles of Cardiff.</p>
<p>4.6.2. Extra geographic constraints for Twitter:</p>
<p>4.6.2.1. The system must allow the user to constrain a query to use tweets that the system believes to be from a predefined geographic region.</p>
<p>4.6.2.2. The system should allow the user to constrain a query to use tweets that the system believes to be from a region that is bounded by a distance from a central point.</p>
<p>4.6.2.3. The system could allow the user to constrain a query to use tweets that the system believes to be from a complex region.</p>
<p>5.Query reporting: </p><pre class="fragment">5.1. The user must be able to specify the frequency of proactive reporting. For example, a report should be generated once per week.    

5.2. The user could be able to specify that a report will be generated when a specific trigger occurs. For example, the system could produce a report when a level of tension has been reached under specific query constraints.    

    5.2.1. The user could be able to specify the triggers that can be use

3.	Low Level Design Overview</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_3_1"></a>
3.1	Description</h2>
<p>In order for the CAT-D system to make predictions on future cohesion and tension levels, the system will perform data analytic comparisons with known, historical data, where predictions are based on previous outcomes given similar trends and input criteria. This is similar to the intuitive nature of the brain which essentially recognises patterns based on previous experience and makes assumptions as to the expected outcome. By matching these trends against historical data the system may be able to quickly draw conclusions as to a predicted outcome with some element of certainty. In the case of a terror attack however, such as that seen on 26th May 2015 in Tunisia, it could been seen that related social media traffic increased dramatically immediately following the attack as you would expect, but petered out rapidly over the following days. There was no detectable indication that an attack was imminent via the twitter data collected within the UK, as one might expect. This trend closely mirrored the content of national news coverage which was possibly only extended due to repatriation timescales. When attempting to identify events of interest prior to an increasedecrease in C&amp;T it is necessary to monitor may sources of social data to ensure representative coverage from the community under analysis. As each community are unique it must be possible to supplement the automated information collection. Additional data added to an analysis job which may be essential for understanding the community but may not be automatically collected by the system. This may be issued to the system as additional RSSWeb sites specifically relevant to the topic or area of interest. For example, the content of a postal flyer may be input into the system as a potential trigger with a 95% population coverage, and a likelihood of consumption score of 18% if issued to an entire community via a postal mail drop. Likewise; minutes of a parish meeting may contain relevant information, the results of which may not be published in a location generally monitored by the system. This documentation must be made available to the system for C&amp;T recalculation. An individual tweet although containing strong sentiment and feeling may only be seen by a small number of followers. Of these follower none of them may be within the area under analysis. This will significantly reduce the importance score of this tweet, such that it may be deemed entirely insignificant. A news article on the other hand is likely to have a wide audience and as such, its importance and frequency is most likely to increase. Local radio may also be reporting an issue, or perhaps hosting a live on air debate about a topic of interest. The transcript if this debate could be input into the system using a speech to txt system such as that offered by IBM Watson development cloud for example. Profiling the origin of data utilised during the analysis of C&amp;T, requires the capturing and tracking of all data associated with a task. This includes the initial topic criteria, time frame, location origin, location perimeter or radius and each data abstract used during the analysis. It may also be useful to identify a network of connections between data sources, such as followers and known connections between data sources. Job configuration allows for the selection of an monitor state. This will prompt the system to continually monitor the topics of interest until such time as the job is postponed or deleted. Also a track historical indication will cause the system to analysis in reverse chronological order, beyond the dates specified by the user, using all relevant data collected in the past, where such data exists. This will enable the user to attempt to retrospectively produce a report of change in C&amp;T for a known event. Take for example a, change in school uniform. It may be assumed that any tension associated with a uniform change is solely due to the uniform, however by analysing historical C&amp;T for this school it may be possible to identify that the tension was already there, prior to the announcement. This information may be useful for a number of reasons, but will also enable the long-term effects of such a change to be monitored. Week, month, year or infinite may specified as monitor_duration options Alert mode enables the CAT-D system to notify the user following an indication of change of C&amp;T state. This will need to be adjusted on a per job basis as some topics will detect a more varies change in state than others. An increasedecrease sensitivity control will be used for hysteresis control. A link within the alert message will enable the user to adjust the sensitivity of the ongoing job where applicable.</p>
<p>A user will be able to create groups that enable analysis tasks to be combined into relevant categorises. These groups can be made available to other members of an agreed set of users of the system. A group owner will have administration rights for the group and only on confirmation will the subscriber gain access to the jobs classified within the group. A user has the option to hide jobs that are of no interest. This differs from a deletion as the job remains visible to other members of the group. A share option will be provided to enable the user to share results with other members of the system or members of a specific group. To avoid spamming of all system users a opt in system will be configured.</p>

3.2	Disabling Strategy</h2>
<pre class="fragment">There are no disabling requirements for the system.
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_3_3"></a>
3.3	Logging Strategy</h2>
<pre class="fragment">Logging is achieved via Tomcat Catalina.out.  The system specific components 
log to the same location for consistency.  By combining the log information within 
this common file it simplifies diagnosis of interaction between components as the log
provide a serialised view of the system and message exchange between components.
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_4"></a>
4.	Security</h1>
<pre class="fragment">There are no security aspects specific to the system.  However there will exist a username.password 
based connection within the WebLab GUI interface which may be used during initial configuration of
the system.
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_5"></a>
5.	Interactions and dependencies</h1>
<pre class="fragment">The system connects via the Internet to a number of external web sites to analyse each site.  For the system to function each site needs to be up and running.  If access is via a proxy server all necessary configuration parameters must be applied.

@note The system automatically sends status reports and results to the parent website.

5.1	Interactions with, and Dependencies on the Existing Systems</h2>
<pre class="fragment">The system has interaction and dependency on existing systems.
WebLab Bundle 2.0.1 provides the framework for the system.
The system is platform independent.  Refer to the systems requirements section for recommended system requirements.

8.	System Resources, Performance and Capabilities</h1>
<pre class="fragment">Performance can be impacted by the following.
 - PC Specification and Performance.
 - Web Server Specification and Performance
 - Internet Connection Speed/Limitations
 - Proxy Server Speed/Limitations
 - Quantity and complexity of data to be analysed.
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_8_1"></a>
8.1	System Resource Usage</h2>
<pre class="fragment">Methods can be run simultaneously so could cause substantial impact to loacl PC and 
Web Server performance, so use of this tool should be restricted to outside of business 
hours..
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_8_2"></a>
8.2	Limitations</h2>
<pre class="fragment">TODO
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="sec_8_3"></a>
8.3	Expansion Considerations</h2>
<pre class="fragment">New methods can be added due to the modular nature of the system.  The system comprises
 of a number of web services, the inferencing system and an orcestration service.  The 
 each service is combined into a chain using Apachie Camel.  These chains can be modified 
 and enhansed services can be inserted into the chains as required.  
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="sec_9"></a>
9.	Reliability</h1>
<pre class="fragment">The methods have been design to incorporate a standard interface to allow the 
reporting of failures during test.

It is the responsibility of the test developer to ensure this mechanism is implemented,
to allow corrective action at the earliest opportunity. 

TODO Elaborate

10.2	Subscriber</h2>
<pre class="fragment">The CAT-D connects to the CAT-D web site in order to verify subscriber details.  Firewall and Proxy Server details must be made available to the tool.

    - Subscriber Customisation Information

@note The test developer can utilize locally stored files rather than web based files in order to reduce network traffic during debug, development, sanity and soak testing.
